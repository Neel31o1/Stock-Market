# First Stock Market Project

## Hi — I'm Neel

Hi! My name is Neel. I’m currently living in Toronto, Canada, while my family lives in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. I’m turning 26 soon, and I want to start learning about the stock market and different ways or funds to invest.

I’m a complete beginner with no prior knowledge of investing or the stock market, but I’m eager to understand how it works. I specifically want to invest my money in the Indian stock market, not in Canada.

For context, I work in IT and can spare ₹10,000–₹15,000 INR every month for investment. Additionally, I can code in Python and PySpark, so I’d love to use data analysis, visualization, or automation to understand trends, analyze stock data, and make smarter investment decisions based on your guidance.

## Project summary

This small personal project is meant to document my learning journey into the Indian stock market and to build simple Python/PySpark tools that help me collect data, visualize trends, and run simple automation (e.g., monthly data pulls, basic indicators). The repository will contain notes, sample scripts, data extraction examples, and a small dashboard or notebook that visualizes the results.

**Goals:**
- Learn core investing concepts and vocabulary.
- Set up a reproducible GitHub repo with code and documentation.
- Collect public market data and visualize it using Python (pandas / matplotlib) and PySpark if/when datasets grow.
- Build simple, repeatable analyses: moving averages, returns, correlation, simple screener.
- Track a small SIP-like monthly investment (₹10k–15k) in mutual funds or selected stocks and simulate outcomes.

## What to learn first (investing basics)

1. **Basic vocabulary**: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, SIP (Systematic Investment Plan), demat account, P&L, dividend, market order vs limit order.
2. **Risk & return**: how risk relates to expected returns, diversification, and why you shouldn’t put all money in one stock.
3. **Time horizon and goals**: define short-term vs long-term goals. For wealth accumulation, long-term SIPs in funds or index-based instruments are often recommended to reduce timing risk.
4. **Tax & account types**: understand NRE vs NRO accounts, repatriation rules, and local tax implications both in India and Canada.
5. **Basic analysis methods**: fundamental vs technical analysis — start with the fundamentals (what the company does, profitability, margins) then learn simple technical indicators for timing if you like.

## Beginner-friendly investment types (short list)

- **Index Mutual Funds / ETFs**: low-cost way to get diversified exposure to the Indian market. Good for beginners.
- **Mutual Funds (SIP)**: Systematic monthly investments into equity or hybrid funds — suits small monthly contributions.
- **Direct Stocks (small basket)**: If you want to learn stock picking, start with a small, diversified basket and only use money you can afford to keep invested long-term.
- **Balanced/Hybrid funds**: if you want a more conservative approach with some equity upside.

## Brokers & access from Canada (notes)

> NOTE: If you are a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) or a foreign resident, investing directly in India requires specific accounts (NRE/NRO, PIS) and KYC steps. Broker offerings, fees, and policies change, so use the broker's official site when you open an account.

(You will find links and up-to-date notes in the project wiki or issues.)

## Long-term strategies (simple, safe starting ideas)

- **SIP into low-cost index funds**: automatic monthly investing reduces timing risk.
- **Dollar-cost averaging**: commit a fixed INR amount (₹10–15k) every month.
- **Diversify**: across sectors and instruments (index funds + 2–3 good stocks or sector funds).
- **Rebalance yearly**: review allocations annually and rebalance.
- **Education & discipline**: keep learning, log your decisions and rationale in the repo.

## Next steps & helpful ideas to add to this repo

- Add notebooks that fetch data for a sample mutual fund or Nifty 50 stocks.
- Add a basic dashboard (Voila / Streamlit) to view month-by-month SIP simulation.
- Add a page for "Account setup checklist" with links to brokers and required documents.
